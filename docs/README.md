## Why Doodle?

### Single-language
Doodle is written entirely in <span style="color:red">[Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org)</span>. Apps written with Doodle do not use HTML, Javascript, CSS or
wrappers around these concepts. All parts of a Doodle app are written in a browser agnostic way using
Kotlin. Doodle apps can actually be written entirely as common (cross-platform) code in multi-platform setups.

### Expressive
Creating expressive, intuitive apps is natural with Doodle. It makes complex rendering easy, simplifies layout and offers a great
deal of flexibility. Doodle also provides intuitive pointer and keyboard support for both desktop and mobile.

Simply define your View hierarchy, business logic and go.

### Vector Oriented
Its easy to build beautifully detailed UIs with Doodle. All rendering in Doodle is vector-oriented; so ellipses, paths,
lines, gradients, affine transforms etc. are as simple to use as images and rectangles. 

### Precise

Doodle gives you control over all aspects of the UI presentation, making it easier to precisely control rendering.

### Modular

Doodle is composed of several libraries and a collection of modules. This allows selective adoption of various features and helps
with bundle size. Apps written with Doodle are also dependency-injected; and there are no global objects or state to make mocking challenging.


## Feedback
